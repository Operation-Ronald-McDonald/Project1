Project One: Take Me Out to the Ballgame

Group Name: Python.Py Dojo

Prince Amponsah, Nick Hancock, Drew Davis

With summer upon us, Python.Py, Dojo wants to bring the best in order to get us all excited for the season. This includes traditions like hotdogs, baseball, and most importantly: beer. We have located and secured a dataset that will help us understand how much and why beer is consumed in Major League stadiums. Questions will include:


Does average household income within the cities for which the stadiums are located have a hand in how much beer is consumed?

Is the teamsâ€™ record correlated with the amount of beer consumed within the stadium?

Why do some stadiums consume more beer than others?

The source of our dataset is based on a few factors:
The US Census
Team Marketing Data Report
